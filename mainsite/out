This went back to a prehistoric Germanic *thwerkhwaz(possible source also of English queer), which in turn was descended from Indo-European *twork-, *twerk- \u2018twist\u2019 (source also of English torch, torment,torture, etc). How the noun thwart\u2018seat across a boat\u2019 [18] fits into the picture is not altogether clear. Its modern meaning clearly connects it with thwart\u2018across\u2019, but the notion of\u2018crosswise\u2019 may have been a secondary development. For an earlier noun thought\u2018seat in a boat\u2019 existed, which came ultimately from Old English thofta\u2018rower\u2019s bench\u2019, and it could be that\u00a0 thwart the modern English noun represents a blending, both formal and semantic, of thwart\u2018across\u2019 with the now obsolete thought.\n", "throng": "throng\n\n\nthrong[13] The etymological notion underlying throng is of \u2018pressing together\u2019.

Sabotage consists in going slow with the process of production when the bosses go slow with the same process in regard to wages. [Arturo M. Giovannitti, quoted in report of the Sagamore Sociological Conference, June 1907]In English, \"malicious mischief\" would appear to be the nearest explicit definition of \"sabotage,\" which is so much more expressive as to be likely of adoption into all languages spoken by nations suffering from this new force in industry and morals.

A little boy who comes across some geese suddenly will find himself hissed at immediately, and a great demonstration of defiance made by them, but if he can pluck up heart to cry 'bo!' loudly and advance upon them, they will retire defeated. The word 'bo' is clearly selected for the sake of the explosiveness of its first letter and the openness and loudness of its vowel. [Walter W.

Earliest French use of the word is as the name of a people apparently in southern Gaul, which led to the now-doubtful, on phonetic grounds, theory that the word comes from Visigothus. The typical use in Old French seems to have been as a derogatory nickname for Normans, the old theory (not universally accepted) being that it springs from their frequent use of the Germanic oath bi God. But OED dismisses in a three-exclamation-mark fury one fanciful version of the \"by god\" theory as \"absurdly incongruous with facts.\" At the end, not much is left standing except Spanish bigote \"mustache,\" which also has been proposed but not explained, and the chief virtue of which as a source seems to be there is no evidence for or against it.In support of the \"by God\" theory, as a surname Bigott, Bygott are attested in Normandy and in England from the 11c., and French name etymology sources (such as Dauzat) explain it as a derogatory name applied by the French to the Normans and representing \"by god.\" The English were known as goddamns 200 years later in Joan of Arc's France, and during World War I Americans serving in France were said to be known as les sommobiches (see also son of a bitch). But the sense development in bigot is difficult to explain. According to Donkin, the modern use first appears in French 16c. This and the earliest English sense, \"religious hypocrite,\" especially a female one, might have been influenced by beguine and the words that cluster around it. Sense extended 1680s to other than religious opinions.\n", "bifurcate": "bifurcate (v.)\n\n1610s, from Medieval Latin bifurcatus, from Latin bi- (see bi-) + furca, the root of fork.
